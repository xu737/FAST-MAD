# Unity is Strength: Efficient Federated Anomaly Detection for Cross-domain Time Series with Sharded LLM [Scalable Data Science [Under Review]
### Get Started
1. Install Python 3.8, PyTorch >= 1.3.1.
2. Download data. You can download SMD, PSM, and MSL from [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1gisthCoE-RrKJ0j3KPV7xiibhHWT9qRm). For the SWaT dataset, you can apply for it by following its official tutorial, link: https://itrust.sutd.edu.sg/itrust-labs_datasets/dataset_info/. For the UCR dataset, you can apply for it by following its official Archive, link:https://www.cs.ucr.edu/~eamonn/time_series_data_2018.
3. Train and evaluate. We provide the experiment script under the folder ./scripts. You can reproduce the experiment results as follows:
```
bash ./scripts/main_tes.sh
```
